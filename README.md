# The Caption Forge

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered meme generator that creates meme captions from any image using computer vision and natural language processing. It combines image captioning with language generation to produce short, dark-humored, Gen Z-style captions rendered directly onto the image.

The result is a meme that blends absurdity, irony, and emotionally charged themesâ€”automatically generated and saved as an image.

## Features

- Uses BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) to describe images
- Generates meme captions using OpenAI's GPT-4o model
- Wraps and renders text on the image with proper formatting
- Designed for dark, minimalist meme humor without emojis or hashtags

## How It Works

1. **Image Description**  
   The script uses a pre-trained BLIP model to generate a caption from the input image.

2. **Caption Generation**  
   The generated caption is passed to GPT-4o using a carefully engineered prompt to produce a one-line meme with a Gen Z tone.

3. **Rendering**  
   The resulting caption is wrapped and rendered onto the image using Python Imaging Library (PIL), styled in white with a black outline for readability.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pillow openai
Additional Setup
An OpenAI API key is required to access GPT-4o. This must be added in the script.

Ensure that sample.jpg exists or replace it with your own image.

The script requires a valid system font path (e.g., Arial on macOS or Windows).

Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Add your OpenAI API key in the script:

python
Copiar
Editar
client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key")
Run the script:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python meme_generator.py
The generated meme will be saved as meme.jpg.

File Structure
bash
Copiar
Editar
meme_generator.py   # Main script
sample.jpg          # Input image
meme.jpg            # Output image with caption
